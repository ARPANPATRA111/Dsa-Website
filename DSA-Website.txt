DSA Website Project Log
This file tracks the progress and plans for the DSA Website project.

âœ… What's Done:
The initial vision has been brought to life! We have a fully functional web application with the following features:
Core Architecture: The application is built on a modern tech stack: React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS for the frontend, with Supabase powering the backend for database and authentication.
Question of the Day: Non-authenticated users are greeted with a daily DSA challenge to keep them engaged.
Full Question Bank: Authenticated admins have access to the complete, filterable, and searchable list of all questions.
Solution Viewing: Each question can have multiple, optimized solutions in different programming languages, complete with syntax highlighting.
Complete Admin Panel: A secure and comprehensive admin panel allows for full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on both questions and their associated solutions.
User Experience: The UI is enhanced with features like dark mode, responsive design, and modals for an expanded code view.
Deployment: The project is set up for easy deployment on Vercel.

ðŸš€ What's Next (Future Plans):
While the core functionality is complete, here are some exciting features planned for the future:
Interactive Code Editor: The biggest upcoming feature is to integrate an interactive code editor (like Monaco or CodeMirror). This would allow users to write, compile, and test their own solutions directly on the website.
Test Case Execution: Alongside the code editor, the plan is to build a system to run user-submitted code against predefined test cases and provide real-time feedback.
User Profiles & Progress Tracking: Introduce user accounts for non-admins to track their progress, save favorite questions, and view their submission history.
Cloud Integration: Explore deeper integration with cloud services for more advanced features, such as more robust code execution environments or data analytics.
